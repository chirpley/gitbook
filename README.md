### **Chirpley (CHRP) Marketing Strategy** <a href="#chirpley_chrp_marketing_strategy" id="chirpley_chrp_marketing_strategy"></a>

* Use of a personal approach and introduce a uniform system for all procedures within the framework of your influencer marketing campaign
* Use multiple tools and methods of assessing a content creator’s suitability and authenticity
* Utilize micro- and nano-influencers. Content creators with followings of a few thousand subscribers and less have loyal audiences. As a result, their engagement rates are much higher than those of influencers with huge followings.

**Strong brand awareness and demand generation will be achieved through the following methods:**

* Content that’s regularly released to the Chirpley community via social media, press, influencers, and KOLs within the cryptocurrency industry located in key regions around the world.
* A pre-launch focus on creating hype around Chirpley and its unlimited potential.
* An appearance on a landing page and mobile app store resulting from storytelling campaigns, social media, content marketing, and paid advertising. Inbound leads will primarily be generated this way.
* The creation of high-res video campaigns that capture viewers' imaginations and take them on a journey through Chirpley.
* Regular content to help build anticipation for the release, such as real images and video of the Chirpley world, real marketing experiences, concept artwork, giveaways, quizzes and polls, user-generated content, features list, video interviews and reviews, and press features.

### **Which Technologies does Chirpley (CHRP) Use?** <a href="#which_technologies_does_chirpley_chrp_use" id="which_technologies_does_chirpley_chrp_use"></a>

**Development:** C# Core.NET, MVC ASP.NET, MSSQL/NOSQL. The system is set up using microservices as the basis.&#x20;

We have implemented and OpenID server in the backend for handling authentication and login in our load balanced server park.

**Software:** The software is split into several layers, front-end, middleware, back-end. Everything is in design asynchronously, and this is something that will grow further in the future. The architecture however is prepared for this.

Entire system is stateless, which implies we can easily scale vertically and horizontally.

To prevent disasters in the future, the entire system is designed from scratch to work behind load balancers. This was proven when we had a bot attack, the system handled the exposure smoothly.

The system will expand in the very near future using some form of message queue, so our microservice architecture will reap full benefit from it's asynchronous design.

**Databases:** The database system is primarily transaction based MSSQL, however mixed with Razor DB (NOSQL) for high storage load and little writes. The combination is very powerful and also very scalable.

**Global scaling:** This architecture is also, in the basis, prepared to scale globally, as all storage can be asynchronously added, there can and will never be a conflict. The system being stateless, we are prepared to 'easily' setup regional satellites and decentral backend systems.

**AI:** A separate engine that can interact with the corresponding microservices. The separate engine can run the algorithms.
